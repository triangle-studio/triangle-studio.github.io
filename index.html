            Of course! Our last work was with <i>ermes</i>, a company that aims to solve missing deliveries.

            We built the iOS app, the backend that managed the deliveries and incoming packages and the artificial intelligence that analyzed incoming shipments.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The app gathered shipping emails from your inbox, detecting incoming shipments. Since that moment you were updated with the status of your packages and able to schedule deliveries for them.

          <p>
            The app gathered ecommerce emails from your inbox, picking the ones containing a valid carrier tracking code. Once you are signed up in the app you are notified about the purchases you make and with status updates for in transit packages, allowing you to schedule a delivery through the ermes messaging service, where you are able to choose desired date and pickup location.

            We built an iOS app and a backend for the logistics process and the carrier status updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            With artificial intelligence we made an analysis that detected shipment emails received when you made any online purchase.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We used Swift for iOS, Ruby on Rails for the backend and Scala and Python for artificial intelligence.
