            Sure! Our last work was with ermes, a company that aims to solve missing deliveries.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built the iOS app, the backend that managed the deliveries and incoming packages and the artificial intelligence that analyzed incoming shipments.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The app gathered shipping emails from your inbox, detecting incoming shipments. Since that moment you were updated with the status of your packages and able to schedule deliveries for them.
